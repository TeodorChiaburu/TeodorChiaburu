### Hi there 👋

My name is Teo. I am a Data Science graduate and since the end of 2021 a passionate PhD candidate in the field of *explainable AI*, aka XAI, at *Berliner Hochschule für Technik*. Whenever 
I'm not working, I'm either dancing or teaching Salsa Cubana, playing table tennis or cooking a delicious meal :yum:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my first paper. The goal is to apply various XAI approaches on Machine Learning models trained to recognize wild bee species from photos :honeybee: (what is called 
*Fine Grained Visual Recognition - FGVR*) and analyze the uncertainty in the explanations generated.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Docker and Kubernetes. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any XAI project (ideally embedded into the broader context of Computer Vision).
- 📫 You can contact me through [mail](teo_chiaburu@yahoo.com), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodor-chiaburu-aa8422b7/) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Teodor_Chiaburu/cv).

Looking forward to hearing from you ;^)
