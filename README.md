### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Teo. I am a Data Science graduate and since the end of 2021 a passionate PhD candidate in the field of *explainable AI*, aka XAI, at *Berliner Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik*. Whenever 
I'm not working, I'm either dancing or teaching Salsa Cubana, playing table tennis or cooking a delicious meal :yum:

ðŸ“« You can contact me through [mail](teo_chiaburu@yahoo.com), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodor-chiaburu-aa8422b7/) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Teodor_Chiaburu/cv). I also have a [personal website](https://teodorchiaburu.github.io/).

Looking forward to hearing from you ;^)
