### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Teo. I am a Data Science graduate and since the end of 2021 a passionate PhD candidate in the field of *explainable AI*, aka XAI, at *Berliner Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik*. Whenever 
I'm not working, I'm either dancing or teaching Salsa Cubana, playing table tennis or cooking a delicious meal :yum:

- :trophy: I have just had the honor to represent my university at the CVPR 2022 in New Orleans with my very first [paper](https://github.com/TeodorChiaburu/beexplainable).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my next paper. The goal is to apply various XAI approaches on Deep Learning models trained to recognize wild bee species from photos :honeybee: (what is called 
*Fine Grained Visual Recognition - FGVR*) and analyze the uncertainty in the explanations generated. I am going to approach this via *Concept Activation Vectors* and *Contrastive Learning Techniques*.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with Docker and Kubernetes. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any XAI project (ideally embedded into the broader context of Computer Vision).
- ðŸ“« You can contact me through [mail](teo_chiaburu@yahoo.com), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodor-chiaburu-aa8422b7/) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Teodor_Chiaburu/cv). I also have a [personal website](https://teodorchiaburu.github.io/).

Looking forward to hearing from you ;^)
